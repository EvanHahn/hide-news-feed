hide the news feed
==================

Like Facebook, but get distracted by the news feed? Me too.

There's a tiny bit of CSS you need to hide the news feed. This repository has build scripts for browser extensions and user styles so that you can hide the news feed anywhere.

Build a Userstyle that works with a number of browser extensions:

    make userstyle
    
Build a Firefox-specific Userstyle:

    make firefox-userstyle
    
Make a Chrome extension:
    
    make chrome-extension

More on the way!
